// concept of hydration comes when doing server side rendering
//Hydration is the process of hydrating the web page with javascript
//We send user the rendered HTML and Style document and javascript separately
//Hydration is the process of taking the snapshot (HTML + CSS) of the website and
//adding the layer of interactivity (javacript)

//Hydration with interactivity with javascript

//Hydration strategies == >What has to be hydrated first and what user want to interact
// with first.

//Sometimes hydration can take time so user will only get snapshot of website
// so progressive hydration is important means that what we are viewing first
//need to be hydrated first and rest can hydrate later
